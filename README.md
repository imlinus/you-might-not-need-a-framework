# you-dont-need-a-framework

Here's a splash of the future and a blast from the past - all in the same codebase.

Code like it's 2009 again. When nobody had a clue what `node_modules` even was.

But do it with UI components, with a freakin' state manager, with Two-Way binding using `Proxy`

And best of all. There's no bloatstrap.css in sight
